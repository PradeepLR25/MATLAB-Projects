# MATLAB-Projects
Structure, Finance, and Modeling projects

1)StructureAnalysis Folder
Contains various scripts written during my PHD to analyse stucture files:
Import data
Calcualtes Ca-Cb distaces from X-ray crystallography file, and outputs coordinates to a new structure file (Native-like contant analysis).
Determines distance distributions from particular atoms.
Determines distances between atoms for 2-5k files and sorts the files in to two piles, accepted and unaccepted.

2)ModelingAndSpectralAnalysis File
This folder contains files that were used to model the following:
Model the decrease in light intesity through an absorptive medium
Fit spectral data using SVD analysis, includes truncation data sets.

3) Finance Folder 
Contains various scripts for use in MATLAB for:
Importing historical stock data from YAHOO API.
Applying various algorithms to filter data, and output potential investments based on certain metrics.
